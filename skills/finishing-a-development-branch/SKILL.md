# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Detect environment → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## Step 1: Verify Tests

Run the project's full test suite (`npm test` / `cargo test` / `pytest` / `go test ./...`).

**If tests fail**, report the failures and stop — the menu comes after a green suite:

```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]
```

In unattended mode (see Step 4), a failing suite here is a blocker under
`autonomous-ticket`'s `## Blockers`, not a plain stop.

**If tests pass:** continue to Step 2.

## Step 2: Detect Environment

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
# Capture now, while still inside the workspace — Step 5 changes directory
# before cleanup (Step 6) needs this value
WORKTREE_PATH=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

This determines which menu to show and how cleanup works:

| State | Menu | Cleanup |
|-------|------|---------|
| `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (normal repo) | Standard 4 options | No worktree to clean up |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, named branch | Standard 4 options | Provenance-based (see Step 6) |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, detached HEAD | Reduced 2 options (no merge) | Externally managed — leave in place |

## Step 3: Determine Base Branch

The base branch is whatever this work forked from — usually named in the
plan, the conversation, or the branch's upstream. Work out your best guess
now; the menu in Step 4 names it, so your human partner confirms or
corrects it in the same reply as their choice. Never merge into a base
they have not seen named: merging into the wrong base is expensive to undo.

## Step 4: Present Options

**Normal repo and named-branch worktree — present exactly these 4 options:**

```
Implementation complete on <feature-branch>, forked from <base-branch> (correct me if not). What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Squash-merge back to <base-branch> locally (one commit)
3. Push and create a Pull Request
4. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)

Which option?
```

**Detached HEAD — present exactly these 2 options:**

```
Implementation complete. You're on a detached HEAD (externally managed workspace), forked from <base-branch> (correct me if not).

1. Push as new branch and create a Pull Request
2. Keep as-is (I'll handle it later)

Which option?
```

**Unattended mode.** When
`test -f "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.superpowers/ticket.json"`
passes, that file's `unattended` is true, and its `authorised` lists both
`push` and `pr`, your human partner has already chosen the push-and-PR path
(option 3 in the 4-option menu, option 1 in the detached-HEAD menu). Do not
present the menu. Run Option 3 with `<feature-branch>` = `git.branch` and
`<base-branch>` = `git.base`, using `gh` when `git.forge` is `github` and
`tea` when it is `gitea`. When the PR exists, through the Linear MCP,
comment its URL on the ticket at `ticket.url` and move the ticket to
`linear.states.finished`. A failing suite in Step 1 is a blocker under
`autonomous-ticket`'s `## Blockers`, not a report in the pane.

Present the menu exactly as written — concise, with every option coming
from the list above. Discarding the work happens only in response to your
human partner explicitly asking for it (see "If your human partner asks to
discard the work" below). Wait for their answer; the integration decision
is theirs.

## Step 5: Execute Choice

### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# Get main repo root for CWD safety
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"

# Merge first — verify success before removing anything
git checkout <base-branch>
git pull
git merge <feature-branch>

# Verify tests on merged result
<test command>
```

If tests fail on the merged result: stop, leave the worktree and branch in
place, and investigate — nothing has been pushed, so the merge is local
and recoverable.

Once the merged result is green: clean up the worktree (Step 6), then
delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

### Option 2: Squash-Merge Locally

Same as Option 1, with the merge replaced by:

```bash
git merge --squash <feature-branch>
git commit
```

Write the squash commit's subject as one line describing the whole change
(the branch's commit subjects are the material). Verify tests on the merged
result exactly as in Option 1. `git branch -d` refuses to delete a
squash-merged branch because its commits are not ancestors of the base;
once the merged result is green and the squash commit exists, use
`git branch -D <feature-branch>` for this option only.

### Option 3: Push and Create PR

```bash
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
# From a detached HEAD, name the new branch on the remote:
# git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/<new-branch>
```

Then create the pull/merge request against <base-branch> with the forge's
tooling — its CLI if one is available, or the creation URL most forges
print when you push — following the repo's PR template and conventions if
present, and report the URL to your human partner.

Keep the worktree — your human partner iterates on PR feedback there.

### Option 4: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

### If your human partner asks to discard the work

This path exists only as a response to an explicit request to throw the
work away. Confirm first:

```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for that exact confirmation. When it arrives:

```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
```

Then clean up the worktree (Step 6) and force-delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

## Step 6: Cleanup Workspace

**Runs for Options 1 and 2 and confirmed discards.** Options 3 and 4 always
preserve the worktree. Both callers have already changed directory to the
main repo root — worktree removal must run from outside the worktree —
and use the `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_COMMON`/`WORKTREE_PATH` values captured in
Step 2, from before that directory change.

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON`:** Normal repo, no worktree to clean up. Done.

**If `WORKTREE_PATH` is under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`:** Superpowers
created this worktree — we own cleanup:

```bash
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"
git worktree prune  # Self-healing: clean up any stale registrations
```

**If removal is refused** (`contains modified or untracked files`): the
worktree holds files that exist nowhere else — uncommitted plans, notes,
or scratch work. Never `--force` on your own initiative. Show your human
partner what is at stake and ask:

```bash
git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" status --porcelain -uall
```

```
Worktree removal refused — these files were never committed:

<file list>

1. Commit them to <branch> before cleanup
2. Move them into <main repo root>
3. Delete them (unrecoverable)

Which?
```

Carry out the choice, then remove the worktree.

**Otherwise:** The host environment owns this workspace — leave it in
place. If your platform provides a workspace-exit tool, use it.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | yes | - | - | yes |
| 2. Squash-merge locally | yes (squash) | - | - | yes (force) |
| 3. Create PR | - | yes | yes | - |
| 4. Keep as-is | - | - | yes | - |
| Discard (explicit request only) | - | - | - | yes (force) |

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Tests passed earlier this session" | Run the suite on the tree you are about to integrate. A green run only proves the tree it ran on. |
| "They obviously want it merged" | Integration is your human partner's decision. Present the menu and wait. |
| "They seem done with this feature — I'll offer to discard it" | The menu is complete as written. Discard happens only when your human partner asks for it in so many words. |
| "'Yeah, get rid of it' counts as confirmation" | Only the typed word `discard` authorizes deletion. |
| "The PR is up, so the worktree is clutter now" | PR feedback gets fixed in that worktree. It stays until the work lands. |
| "This other worktree looks stale — I'll clean it too" | Clean up only worktrees under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`. Everything else belongs to the host. |
| "Removal refused — `--force` is just finishing the cleanup" | The refusal means files exist only in that worktree. `--force` destroys them permanently. Show your human partner and ask. |
| "The merged-result failure is probably flaky" | A failing merged result stops everything. Branch and worktree stay put while you investigate. |
| "The base branch is obviously main" | Name the fork point in the menu so your human partner can correct it. Merging into the wrong base is expensive to undo. |
| "The push was rejected — force-push will fix it" | A rejected push means the remote moved. Investigate; force-push only on your human partner's explicit request. |
